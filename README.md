- **Customizable UI:** The UI generated by this plugin is customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your specific requirements. You can control the appearance and behavior of the UI elements.

- **Route Exposition:** In addition to the dashboard integration, this plugin exposes your entity documents via a specific route. This makes it easy for your store to interact with these documents programmatically.
